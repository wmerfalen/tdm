# Install a device

# Command
This can be used to install claymore mines and cameras. When you run the install command, you are blocked from being able to move or attack for the duration of the installation procedure. The only way to resume moving and/or attacking is to wait until the installation procedure finishes or interrupt it using the `cancel` command.
