# Shows a specific loot item

# Command
This command should be used with the other loot commands. This command allows you to show the stats of a piece of loot that you won from killing an NPC. 

# Usage
`show_loot <index>`

# Step one: kill a mob
Kill a mob any way you like. Look for the loot message after you kill the mob.

# Step two: list the loot you currently have
`list_loot`

This should give you a listing of items you were awarded, including the most recent piece of loot awarded to you from your last kill.

# Step three: use `show_loot` to get stats
`show_loot 1`

# Step four: take the loot
`take_loot 1`

# Best practice
It's best to check items in your loot container on a frequent basis. If you leave items in the loot container (by not taking them), you risk losing the loot from logging out or after a server restart. 

# Junk
The junk command can be used to get rid of something you don't like.
`junk <item>`
