# Get the positions of nearby enemies

# Ability
Aerial Drone Scan allows the user to see the positions of enemies without having to scan or enter said rooms. This works well with the overhead map activated. 

# Enabling overhead map
You might want to enable the overhead map feature. When a drone scan is performed, the overhead map is populated with enemies in a way that makes sense visually. 

# How to enable overhead map
`automap`

# Usage
`ghost:aerial_drone_scan`

# A note to our visually impaired users
We are trying to work towards a good way to make this ability user-friendly to our visually impaired users. As of right now, a plan is in place to test the effectiveness of this ability in such a way as not to force the visually impaired into using the overhead map. We are aware of this and are striving to make this better.

# Feedback
We are always looking for user feedback for this ability.
