# General topic: Claymore Mines

# Overview
Claymore mines can be set on exits and will be detonated when an enemy leaves or enters a room corressponding with the exit the mine was planted on. When you run the install command, you are blocked from being able to move or attack for the duration of the installation procedure. The only way to resume moving and/or attacking is to wait until the installation procedure finishes or interrupt it using the `cancel` command.
