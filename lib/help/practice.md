# Practice a particular skill

# Command
This command, with no arguments, will tell you how many practice sessions you have. Practice sessions are gained by leveling up. 

# What to practice
If you'd like to practice a new or existing skill, run the `skills` command.

# How to practice:
# Step one: find the shortened version of the skill using the `skills`  command
As a CONTAGION, my `skills` page shows me the following:
`Corpse Explosion (ce) [ terrible ]`
This means that I can practice the `Corpse Explosion` skill by typing:
`practice ce`

# How to become proficient
The only way to become better at a particular skill is to level up and to use the skill constantly. Using the skill will change the value from `[ terrible ]` to a progressively better value like `[ decent ]`
