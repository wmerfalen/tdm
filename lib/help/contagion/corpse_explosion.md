# Set a corpse to explode

# Ability
This ability allows the user to detonate a corpse. The detonation will take a random amount of time to detonate, though it should be enough time for the player to leave the room.

# Usage

# Example
`contagion:corpse_explosion enforcer`

# Notes
If no corpses exist in the room, they can be dragged from other rooms.

# How to drag corpses
