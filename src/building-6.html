<H2><A NAME="s6">6. Zone Files</A></H2>

<P>Zone files are the files that control how areas are configured and how
they reset.  They integrate the mobiles, objects, and rooms to create an
inhabited world.</P>
<P>A zone file contains certain initial information (specified below),
followed by a series of reset commands.  Each time a zone is reset, the
server executes all the commands in order from beginning to end.  All zones
are reset when the server first boots, and periodically reset again while
the game is running.</P>

<P>Lines starting with <CODE>*</CODE> are considered comments and ignored.  Zone commands
themselves may also be followed by a comment delimited by a single <CODE>*</CODE>.
The zone's commands must then be terminated by the literal letter <CODE>S</CODE>.</P>
<P>
<DL>
<DT><B>Virtual Number</B><DD><P>An arbitrary number used to identify the zone.  Zone numbers are
traditionally the room numbers of the zone divided by 100; for example,
Midgaard, which consists of rooms 3000 through 3099, is zone 30.</P>

<DT><B>Zone Name</B><DD><P>A label given to the zone so that it can be identified in system logs.</P>

<DT><B>Top Room Number</B><DD><P>The highest numbered room belonging to this zone.  A room with virtual
number V belongs to zone N if TopRoom(zone N-1) &lt; V &lt;= TopRoom(zone N)
for all N &gt; 0.  Rooms belong to zone 0 if their number is between 0 and the
top of zone 0.</P>

<DT><B>Lifespan</B><DD><P>The number of real-time minutes between zone resets for this zone. 
When the age of the zone (measured in minutes since the last time that zone
has been reset) reaches the zone's lifespan, the zone is queued for reset. 
The zone is then reset when it reaches the front of the queue, and the
conditions of the Reset Mode (see below) are satisfied.</P>

<DT><B>Reset Mode</B><DD><P>Can take one of three values (0, 1, or 2):
<DL>
<DT><B>0</B><DD><P>Never reset the zone.  In this case, the age of the zone is never
updated, and it will never be queued for reset.  Thus, the value
of the Lifespan is effectively ignored.</P>

<DT><B>1</B><DD><P>Reset the zone only after it reaches its Lifespan
<EM>and</EM> after the
zone becomes deserted, i.e. as soon as there are no players
located within the zone (checked once every minute).  This can
make a zone more ``fair'' because it will keep the hard mobs from
reappearing in the zone until everyone leaves, but on a busy MUD
it can prevent a zone from ever being reset since the zone may never
stay empty for more than one minute.</P>

<DT><B>2</B><DD><P>Reset the zone as soon as it reaches its Lifespan,
regardless of who or what is in it.  This is the most
commonly used Reset Mode.</P>

<H2><A NAME="ss6.2">6.2 Zone Commands</A></H2>

<P>Each command consists of a letter, identifying the command-type,
followed by three or four arguments.  The first argument, common to all the
commands, is called the ``if-flag.''  If the if-flag for a command is 1, that
command is only executed if the command immediately before it was executed
as well.  If the if-flag is 0, the command is always executed.  If-flags are
useful for things like equipping mobiles--you don't want to try to equip
a mobile that has not been loaded.</P>
<P>Commands that load mobiles and objects also include a ``max existing''
argument.  This specifies the maximum number of copies of the mobile or
object that are allowed to exist in the entire world at once.  If the number
currently existing is greater than or equal to the ``max existing'' limit, the
command is not executed.</P>
<P>The valid zone-reset commands are M, O, G, E, P, D, and R.</P>
<P>
<DL>
<DT><B>M: load a mobile</B><DD><P>Format: M &lt;if-flag&gt; &lt;mob vnum&gt; &lt;max existing&gt; &lt;room vnum&gt;</P>
<P>Mob vnum is the vnum of the mob to be loaded.  Room vnum is the vnum of
the room in which the mob should be placed.  The mob will be loaded
into the room.</P>

<DT><B>O: load an object</B><DD><P>Format: O &lt;if-flag&gt; &lt;obj vnum&gt; &lt;max existing&gt; &lt;room vnum&gt;</P>
<P>Obj vnum is the vnum of the obj to be loaded.  Room vnum is the vnum of
the room in which the obj should be placed.  The object will be loaded
and left lying on the ground.</P>

<DT><B>G: give object to mobile</B><DD><P>Format: G &lt;if-flag&gt; &lt;obj vnum&gt; &lt;max existing&gt;</P>
<P>Obj vnum is the vnum of the obj to be given.  The object will be loaded
and placed in the inventory of the last mobile loaded with an ``M''
command.</P>
<P>This command will usually be used with an if-flag of 1, since
attempting to give an object to a non-existing mobile will result in an
error.</P>

<DT><B>E: equip mobile with object</B><DD><P>Format: E &lt;if-flag&gt; &lt;obj vnum&gt; &lt;max existing&gt; &lt;equipment position&gt;</P>
<P>Obj vnum is the vnum of the obj to be equipped.  The object will be
loaded and added to the equipment list of the last mobile loaded with
an ``M'' command.  Equipment Position should be one of the following:

<P>This command will usually be used with an if-flag of 1, since
attempting to give an object to a non-existing mobile will result in an
error.</P>

<DT><B>P: put object in object</B><DD><P>Format: P &lt;if-flag&gt; &lt;obj vnum 1&gt; &lt;max existing&gt; &lt;obj vnum 2&gt;</P>
<P>An object with Obj Vnum 1 will be loaded, and placed inside of the copy
of Obj Vnum 2 most recently loaded.</P>
<P>This command will usually be used with an if-flag of 1, since
attempting to put an object inside of a non-existing object will result
in an error.</P>

<DT><B>D: set the state of a door</B><DD><P>Format: D &lt;if-flag&gt; &lt;room vnum&gt; &lt;exit num&gt; &lt;state&gt;</P>
<P>Room vnum is the virtual number of the room with the door to be set.
Exit num being one of:

</P>
<P>Care should be taken to set both sides of a door correctly.  Closing
the north exit of one room does not automatically close the south exit
of the room on the other side of the door.</P>

<DT><B>R: remove object from room</B><DD><P>Format: R &lt;if-flag&gt; &lt;room vnum&gt; &lt;obj vnum&gt;</P>
<P>If an object with vnum Obj Vnum exists in the room with vnum Room Vnum,
it will be removed from the room and purged.</P>
