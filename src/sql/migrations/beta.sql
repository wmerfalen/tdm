{hr} There are different ranges of combat in TD.
 {blu}1) Ranged combat{/blu}
 {blu}2) Close quarters combat{/blu}

 When you use the ''snipe'' command and hit a target that is a few rooms away   
 from you, you are engaging in ranged combat. You are free to move around and 
 do not need to flee from combat. As long as your target doesn''t walk into    
 the room you reside in and subsequently attack you, you are safe to move     
 around freely.                                                               
                                                                              
 However, if you choose to go into the same room as your target, or if your   
 target moves to your room, you are now in Close Quarters Combat range.       
                                                                              
 When you are engaged in CQC, the dynamics of battle change. If you are       
 wielding a Sniper rifle, you will not be able to hit your target as sniper   
 rifles only work on targets that are not in the same room as you.            
                                                                              
 Now if you were to use any other type of ranged weapon like an A.R., or a    
 sub-machine gun, you could continue doing battle with your target even if    
 they are in the same room as you.                                            
                                                                              
 There some exceptions to this rule. Mainly, if you have an underbarrel       
 attachment like a shotgun underbarrel attached to your sniper rifle.         
                                                                              
 If you are wielding a weapoon in your SECONDARY position, you would be able  
 use that weapon in CQC range. All weapons that can be wielded in the         
 SECONDARY position can seemlessly deal damage to targets in the CQC range.   
                                                                              
 But sometimes you want more control over how you react to a target that goes 
 from RANGED comat to CQC combat. This is where Rules of Engagement come into 
 play.                                                                        
                                                                              
 Rules of engagement allow you to dictate how you respond to an enemy closing 
 the distance on you. There are different types of rules of engagement        
 available to you:                                                            

 {blu}1) Ballistic{/blu}
 {blu}2) CQC{/blu} 
 {blu}3) Auxiliary{/blu}
 {blu}4) Secondary{/blu}

 {blu}Ballistic{/blu}
 When your rules of engagement are set to Ballistic, when a target closes the 
 distance and appears in your room, you will continune to use your primary    
 weapon as long as your primary is not a sniper rifle                         

 {blu}CQC{/blu}
 When your rules of engagement are set to CQC, when a target closes the       
 distance and appears in your room, you will use hand to hand combat.         
 If you have set a combat order (see the helpfile for combat_ordere), you will
 proceed to throw the maneuvers you specified.                                


 {blu}Auxiliary{/blu}
 When your rules of engagement are set to Auxiliary, when a target closes the 
 distance and appears in your room, you will use the underbarrel attachment   
 on your primary weapon to engage your target. This will work as long as your 
 attachment has ammunition.

 {blu}Secondary{/blu}
 When your rules of engagement are set to Secondary, when a target closes the 
 distance and appears in your room, you will use the weapon in your secondary 
 position.

If the unlock-event is neither of the above strings, then it will be fed to the system
and handled accordingly.
Example of a custom event:
{blu}Example: {yel}install_minigame "North Door Lock" medium custom "custom event. handled by system"{/yel}
The ''custom'' keyword takes whatever you pass in and the system interprets it. This is for adding custom events
that might work in the future or if the developers have a custom even that allow you to do special things.
As of this writing, there are no custom events. 2020-09-28
