# Raids

## Step 1A: Create Objective types
## Phase 1: what can be done now:
[ ] Eliminate the enemy threat
[ ] Recover documents

## Phase 2: what needs work:
[ ] Diffuse the bomb
[ ] Plant the bomb
[ ] Sabotage enemy installment
[ ] Hold down the objective

## Step 1B: Randomly select an area in the MUD
[ ] Area cannot be where a currently existing RAID is occuring
[ ] Select a spot where the player will enter
	[ ] These will have to be pre-designated rooms

# Step 2: Broadcast contract of Objective Type over MUD radio
[ ] Tell players that a new contract has been aquired
[ ] Players opt-in by typing 'join RAID N'

## Step 3: Player types join RAID N
[x] Generate a randomized scaled version of a mob
[x] Place a random number of the randomized mobs in said area
	[ ] Area MUST be away from spawn
[ ] Teleport player to starting point of area

Raids are a way to create dynamically scaled mobs and content. Preferably, a
raid is autogenerated by the system, but they can be created manually as well.

# Step 1: create a raid
- [x] `admin:raid:pave on <name> <level> <type>`

- [x] This will start "raid" mode.
- [x] While in "raid" mode, any mbuild or zbuild commands will be associated with your raid
	- [x] mbuild will be associated with that raid id
	- [ ] zbuild commands will be associated with that raid id

# Step 2: choose your NPC's
`admin:raid:npc:add <name>`

- Adds a specific NPC to the raid.
- Current list of available NPC's are:


if mob is marked with raid id, do we need to set it on zone data?
	- yes, because mob vnum id's are recycled

admin:raid:create <name> <level> <type>

output: 

"Congratulations, you have started to build raid content.
FROM here on out, until you type admin:raid:done, all mobs and 
zone placements will have a raid id of <RAID_ID>
"
... any mbuild, zbuild commands will have `raid_id` set to current raid

admin:raid:done
