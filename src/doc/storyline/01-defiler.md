# The Defiler

Reports of an underground organization have been circulating regarding the 
Allied Foods market. From what we can gather, the market has not hired from
the public. All employees are unidentified individuals from international
origin. Interpol paints a bleak picture of an elaborate human trafficking
operation centered around high valued illegal goods.

We need to investigate the Allied Foods market building. There have been
several reports of large industrial freezers being offloaded from the
back of the building's loading area. Normally, a marketplace will receive
large quantities of meat in freezer compartments, however this case is
different. All meat shipments are the size of human adults. 

# Quest 1: Infiltration of Allied Foods' butcher area
We need you to enter the Allied Foods marketplace and find the butcher
section and search through the freezer section. Remember: our intelligence
reports say that an the Allied Foods marketplace is a front for human
trafficking.. particularly organ harvesting. We need you to pick up a biometric
scanner from Doctor Magnus Ortem at the TRITON Laboratory. You will use
this biometric scanner to test various samples in the Allied Foods
hidden freezer section in the south end of the store.
that may point toward illegal activity. I've got clearance from very high
up on this one, and the district attorney is just itching to find a reason
to blow the cover on this operation. 

# Quest 1: Armed Resistance
	- RADIO: "We did not expect for there to be armed guards, but it's also not

# Quest 1: Plant listening device
	- RADIO: "We need you to plant several WiFi radio beacons in the Butcher area. 
		You've already managed to break into the Butcher area, so we'll need you to
		install this device into the back of the computers in the room where you found
		the Safe"
# Quest 1: Gained entrance to Butcher area
	- RADIO: "Shit! We've detected several black SUV's on their way to your position
		right now! Prepare for a fight!"
# Quest 1: Killed off the MOBs from the SUV's
	- RADIO: "It looks like one heavily protected SUV is on the way. We believe this
		vehicle is harboring the individual known simply as The Defiler. Get to the 
		loading dock and wait for his arrival."
# Quest 1: The Defiler shows up
	- RADIO: "There he is! He's armed! Take him down!"

# Quest 2: 
It appears that the organization behind this operation consists of a group of human
traffickers related to the same people that own the Hartford Bank in Metro Downtown.
It appears that a large portion of the illegal profits are being laundered through
several international funnels in a complicated web of underhanded transactions.
Due to the firefight that ensued in the Allied Foods Butcher area, we did not expect
them to continue operations, however their brazen attitude is ultimately what will
lead to their downfall. 
We've identified a man who is simply known as The Defiler. His real name is unidentified,
but we know he will be in the Butcher area tonight. We need you to infiltrate the
Butcher area once again and take him out. We believe that this will cause a significant
blow to their operations and slow them down until we can figure out where exactly
these goods are coming from.
