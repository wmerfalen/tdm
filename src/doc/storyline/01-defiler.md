# The Defiler

Reports of an underground organization have been circulating regarding the 
Allied Foods market. From what we can gather, the market has not hired from
the public. All employees are unidentified individuals from international
origin. Interpol paints a bleak picture of an elaborate human trafficking
operation centered around high valued illegal goods.

We need to investigate the Allied Foods market building. There have been
several reports of large industrial freezers being offloaded from the
back of the building's loading area. Normally, a marketplace will receive
large quantities of meat in freezer compartments, however this case is
different. All meat shipments are the size of human adults. 

# Quest 1: Infiltration of Allied Foods' butcher area
We need you enter the Allied Foods marketplace and find take several samples
of the meat that is being stored. Once you have the samples, bring them back
to the TRITON science lab here in the COBALT Forward Operating Base.

# Quest 1: Armed Resistance
	- RADIO: "We did not expect for there to be armed guards, but it's also not
		surprising. Take them out!"
# Quest 1: After killing resistance
	- RADIO: "Search the guards for a fob of some sort to get into the freezer area."
# Quest 1: Found keycard
	- RADIO: "Great, you've found the mechanism to get into the butcher area. Use the 
		card to unlock the door to the Butcher area"
# Quest 1: Plant listening device
	- RADIO: "We need you to plant several WiFi radio beacons in the Butcher area. 
		You've already managed to break into the Butcher area, so we'll need you to
		install this device into the back of the computers in the room where you found
		the Safe"
# Quest 1: Gained entrance to Butcher area
	- RADIO: "Shit! We've detected several black SUV's on their way to your position
		right now! Prepare for a fight!"
# Quest 1: Killed off the MOBs from the SUV's
	- RADIO: "Good job killing off the resistance. We will need to take samples of the 
		meats in those bottom compartments. Grab the samples and head back to the 
		TRITON Labs here on the COFOB."

# Quest 2: 
It appears that the organization behind this operation consists of a group of human
traffickers related to the same people that own the Hartford Bank in Metro Downtown.
It appears that a large portion of the illegal profits are being laundered through
several international funnels in a complicated web of underhanded transactions.
Due to the firefight that ensued in the Allied Foods Butcher area, we did not expect
them to continue operations, however their brazen attitude is ultimately what will
lead to their downfall. 
We've identified a man who is simply known as The Defiler. His real name is unidentified,
but we know he will be in the Butcher area tonight. We need you to infiltrate the
Butcher area once again and take him out. We believe that this will cause a significant
blow to their operations and slow them down until we can figure out where exactly
these goods are coming from.
