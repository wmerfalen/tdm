You approach the sierra nevada bridge. Below the bridge are three bodies hung by their necks. The wind gently pushes each body to swing in a morbid dance of twisting and swaying.

Do you wish to investigate? 
[yes: approach body 1]

# approach body 1
You walk up to the first body. The assailant was badly wounded in the chest as can be seen by the dried blood staining the upper torso.

# approach body 2
You walk up to the second body.. the eyes and forehead have been carved using an extremely sharp cutting instrument. A crow sits nearby waiting for you to leave so that it can finish it's meal

# approach body 3
The last body still has all his gear on. The dog tag has something inscribed over the name.. the name, you can't make out. Someone carved the phrase "rise" into the dog tag using a chemical burning process.

The last body has an object stuffed between the kevlar vest and the body. You attempt to pry the object out... a beeping noise...
*** BOOM ***
The kevlar vest explodes into you knocking you back! The blinding light of the explosion is the last thing you see, pain the last thing you feel... 

---- you slip in and out of consciousness ----
... You become aware for a brief moment ... long enough to recognize that you are falling ....

... the wind rushes past your body and you feel the unnerving loss of orientation ...

... as you slip in and out of consiousness, you briefly see the bottom of a canyon approaching you quickly ...

... you brace yourself for impact ...

# Hidden narrative behind the following
- two TBA entities here:
	- Cartel. (known as TBA)
	- Oil baron company name (known as TBA1)
	- Private contractors employed by TBA1 (known as TBA2)

TRITON labs has been developing a device that transports carbon based lifeforms from one place to another as long as there is water 
below the device. The requirement of water is unknown since the device is based on back-engineered technology found in the pyramids
of Giza (SP?).

The sierra nevada bridge is the site of 3 hangings by the violent and chaotic cartel drug lords in the area. The cartel known as 
*TBA*. These violent crimes were being perpetrated in an effort to stave off interest by private contractors who have been 
dispatched into the area to conduct recon. *TBA* has been known to corrupt and infiltrate the local oil fields who employ said
contracting firms. By using a combination of harrassment and IT infrastructure compromise, *TBA* was able to extract exact 
positions and operations of *TBA2*.

In an operation to collect information on *TBA*, *TBA2* dispatched to the sierra nevada bridge where they were met with
overwhelming resistance. A chemical agent was used, and since *TBA2* did not come equipped with proper mask equipment, 
they were quickly subdued and captured as the chemicals used had strong benzodiazapine (SP?) elements. 

After being tortured and brutalized, *TBA2* were executed and hanged on the Sierra Nevada bridge as a brazen display
of territorial dominance but mostly as a warning of the horros that the *TBA* were capable of. 

After contact had been severed with mother base, the character is dispatched to the Sierra Nevada bridge.

.. a general numbness can be felt throughout your body ...

... you open your eyes but dried blood on your face prevents you from opening them all the way ...

... your handlers pull you over several steps and the sound of a heavy door slams and the ambient noise of the outdoors is suddenly cut off ....
