# Level 1-2 playtesting for MARINE class
For this playtest, I decided to use the G36C Assault Rifle. 
You have to get insanely close to your target which means you die a lot faster.
At level 1, your HP is only 10, but as soon as you level up that goes to 80HP at level 2.

I'd like for there to be a better range for assault rifles.

# Armor/stats don't feel like they do much
Wearing the basic armor that you can find in the armor locker at recall doesn't seem to do
much. Though, I *am* level 1, so that might be why.
