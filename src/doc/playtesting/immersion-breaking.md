# As a GHOST class
- I can 'get 552 Weapons' and it will pick up the Weapons locker
- '552 Commando' should be renamed so that a number isn't at the beginning
- I have to run 'get Commando Weapons' to correctly get the '552 Commando' in the Weapons locker

# Mob issues
- The Kidnappers near the Abandoned Two way street 
	- cannot be sniped
		- target appears out of range
