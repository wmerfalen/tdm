	- fire dissolvers
	- rooms can now be set on fire. they will now transition from the various fire statuses every few ticks
	- mods::values namespace
		- this namespace is globally available and will hold all dynamics integers/floats/strings
	- fixed extractions
		- if a player dies, the player was stuck in limbo. extractions now work perfectly, however mobs still remember you after you died. this could be a good or bad dynamic
	- behaviour trees fixed
		- behaviour trees for snipe tracking are now working properly
	- mobs remember by uuids instead of legacy char\_data pointers
	- mods::weapons::damage\_types
		- rifle_attack should be the *only* way you can snipe someone
		- lots of the dynamics for remotely attacking mobs is now put in rifle_attack function
	- issues:
		- mobs will remember you if you die and come back into the game
			- and they will attack you
		- we are still highly reliant on the damage() function within fight.cpp
