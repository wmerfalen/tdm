[ ] Rbuild Sandbox
	- Status: [ not implemented ]
		- There is code referencing an rbuild_sandbox command but it's just a wrapper to pave mode
		- TODO:'s
			- [ ] HIGH PRIORITY:
				- [ ] MUST verify that there is a way to transfer to a new zone
				- [ ] MUST be able to create a sandbox in the middle of nowhere (and not attached in any way to existing rooms)
				- [ ] MUST be able to specify a zone
					- [ ] MUST verify that an ADMIN player can transfer to another zone
					- [ ] MUST verify that a player can transfer to another zone
			- [ ] create a `sandbox` table
				- [ ] id, name
			- [ ] tie rooms, objects, and mobs to the sandbox id
				- [ ] add a `room_sandbox_id` to the `room` table
				- [ ] add a `mob_sandbox_id` to the `mobile` table
				- [ ] add a `obj_sandbox_id` to the `object` table
			- the point in having the sandbox id on each table is that if the builder wants to, he can delete the sandbox from the `sandbox` table and it will cause anything with that sandbox id to be removed from the room, object, mob tables
			- [ ] each `*_sandbox_id` should be nullable
				- so that when the builder is satisfied with their work, they can commit the sandbox and the system will no longer need the sandbox_id fields. the system can also remove the corresponding sandbox in the sandbox table
				- 
	- bigger picture
		- creating sandboxes is likely going to be the best avenue for getting to a procedurally generated arena of content like in diablo's 2 and 3.
			- content can be generated and subsequently destroyed by deleting anything matching that sandbox id


[ ] Lockers
	- Status:
			- TODO's:
				- no way to set quota of an id
					- need to reflect this in the cache as well
				- need to set a hard limit to how many entries can appear per room/type
					- enforce this once contents of a locker are fetched from sql
						- as well as cached contents
					- display a log SYSERR message about truncated contents

[ ] Every N+X ticks
	[ ] The contents of each crate are mixed up
	[ ] When looking into a crate it will tell you when
		the contents will be randomized next

[ ] Unlocking crates of ammo/weapons
	[ ] Depending on where the crate is, an item is chosen
		[ ] If room contains Kojima
			[ ] Require the sacrifice of 'N tengu masks'
	[ ] When killing any tengu mob, they will drop a tengu mask

[ ] Dynamic mob scaling
	[x] scale a mob's attributes according to a level
	[x] copy extended type from source to scaled mob
	[x] copy the mob equipment profile to scaled mob
		**** ----- PRIORITY -------- ****
		[ ] use the rifle loot rifle randomization code to create randomized weapons
		[ ] equip scaled mob with randomized weapon
		[?] should this be deep rifle objects? might be easier to do that

[ ] `admin:raid:broadcast <ID>`
[x] `admin:raid list`
[x] `admin:raid remove <id>...[id-N]`
[ ] `admin:raid:reload`
	- reloads all raids from the db
	- cannot be ran if currently in raid pave mode
	

[ ] Randomized objectives that target currently playing players
	[ ] Loop over the currently playing player list
		[ ] create a randomized objective for that player's level
		[ ] send notice of randomized objective over MUD RADIO (<-- create this)
		[ ] create 'raid:join <N>' command, and when they type it in:
			[x] Create scaled mobs
				[ ] stretch goal, use a cut scene where the player boards a helicopter
					[ ] have it put them in helicopter limbo
					[ ] helicopter ride is over when the `admin:queue:refresh` call is done
						[ ] have the `admin:queue:refresh` functionality be tied to specific run ID's
							[ ] these ID's will allow the system to track when a refresh for specific content is done
			[ ] Disperse mobs and content to area
			[ ] Teleport player to raid location
			[ ] Mark player with specific contract and scripted steps
[ ] Set a designated spawn room where the player will teleport to
	[ ] create `raid:build:set-spawn <raid-id-N> <room_vnum|here|this>`
		[ ] Only needs to persist during runtime




# Needed content
A new inventory room has been created
	[ ] Plans are to make this a shop where MP can be spent to upgrade gear
[ ] Need to populate Hydro Plant with dynamic mobs
	[ ] Need NPC's to spawn there
	[ ] Need to drop one of the various types of Shards ( see below )

[ ] Need to spawn level 10 NPC's for the euclid avenue areas south of Henley Fountain





# Behaviour trees

		- [ ] Ammunition/Grip
	- [ ] Razor
		- [ ] Intelligence related (FIXME)
	- [ ] Ionic

# ON HOLD
- [ ] upsert orm function
- [ ] sql create table from ORM TUPLE
	- [ ] using notch orm class as guinea pig
