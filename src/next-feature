Raids are a way to create dynamically scaled mobs and content. Preferably, a
raid is autogenerated by the system, but they can be created manually as well.

# Step 1: create a raid
`admin:raid:create <name> <level> <type>`

- This will start "raid" mode.
- While in "raid" mode, any mbuild or zbuild commands will be associated with your raid

# Step 2: choose your NPC's
`admin:raid:npc:add <name>`

- Adds a specific NPC to the raid.
- Current list of available NPC's are:


if mob is marked with raid id, do we need to set it on zone data?
	- yes, because mob vnum id's are recycled

admin:raid:create <name> <level> <type>

output: 

"Congratulations, you have started to build raid content.
FROM here on out, until you type admin:raid:done, all mobs and 
zone placements will have a raid id of <RAID_ID>
"
... any mbuild, zbuild commands will have `raid_id` set to current raid

admin:raid:done




[x] Create raid table
	[ ] Create mods/raid.cpp
	[ ] Add support for `mbuild attr raid <id>`
	[ ] `admin:raid:pave on`
		[ ] `admin:raid:set:spawn <raid-id> <room-vnum|this>`
		[ ] `admin:raid:create <name> <level> <type>`
		[ ] `zbuild raid <mob-vnum>`
		[ ] `mbuild <vnum> attr raid <raid-id>`
		[ ] ... create mobs and zone data ...
		[ ] `mbuild mode <none|default>`
[ ] Randomized objectives that target currently playing players
	[ ] Loop over the currently playing player list
		[ ] create a randomized objective for that player's level
		[ ] send notice of randomized objective over MUD RADIO (<-- create this)
		[ ] create 'raid:join <N>' command, and when they type it in:
			[ ] Create scaled mobs and content
				[ ] stretch goal, use a cut scene where the player boards a helicopter
					[ ] have it put them in helicopter limbo
					[ ] helicopter ride is over when the `admin:queue:refresh` call is done
						[ ] have the `admin:queue:refresh` functionality be tied to specific run ID's
							[ ] these ID's will allow the system to track when a refresh for specific content is done
			[ ] Disperse mobs and content to area
			[ ] Teleport player to raid location
			[ ] Mark player with specific contract and scripted steps
[ ] Set a designated spawn room where the player will teleport to
	[ ] create `raid:build:set-spawn <raid-id-N> <room_vnum|here|this>`
		[ ] Only needs to persist during runtime
