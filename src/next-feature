[ ] mods/rifle-stats.cpp
	[ ] cache invalidation for 
	```
		std::string format_rifle_stats_page(std::string_view feed_file,std::map<std::string,std::string>* page);
	```
	[ ] store mod/access times of yaml files
		[ ] invalidate cache if time is newer
		[ ] regenerate page

[ ] Dynamic mob scaling
	[x] scale a mob's attributes according to a level
	[x] copy extended type from source to scaled mob
	[x] copy the mob equipment profile to scaled mob
		[ ] use the rifle loot rifle randomization code to create randomized weapons
		[ ] equip scaled mob with randomized weapon
		[?] should this be deep rifle objects? might be easier to do that

[ ] `admin:raid:broadcast <ID>`
[x] `admin:raid list`
[x] `admin:raid remove <id>...[id-N]`
[ ] `admin:raid:reload`
	- reloads all raids from the db
	- cannot be ran if currently in raid pave mode
	

[ ] Randomized objectives that target currently playing players
	[ ] Loop over the currently playing player list
		[ ] create a randomized objective for that player's level
		[ ] send notice of randomized objective over MUD RADIO (<-- create this)
		[ ] create 'raid:join <N>' command, and when they type it in:
			[x] Create scaled mobs
				[ ] stretch goal, use a cut scene where the player boards a helicopter
					[ ] have it put them in helicopter limbo
					[ ] helicopter ride is over when the `admin:queue:refresh` call is done
						[ ] have the `admin:queue:refresh` functionality be tied to specific run ID's
							[ ] these ID's will allow the system to track when a refresh for specific content is done
			[ ] Disperse mobs and content to area
			[ ] Teleport player to raid location
			[ ] Mark player with specific contract and scripted steps
[ ] Set a designated spawn room where the player will teleport to
	[ ] create `raid:build:set-spawn <raid-id-N> <room_vnum|here|this>`
		[ ] Only needs to persist during runtime
