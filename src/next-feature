[ ] Lockers
	- Status:
			- TODO's:
				- no way to set quota of an id
					- need to reflect this in the cache as well
				- need to set a hard limit to how many entries can appear per room/type
					- enforce this once contents of a locker are fetched from sql
						- as well as cached contents
					- display a log SYSERR message about truncated contents

[ ] Every N+X ticks
	[ ] The contents of each crate are mixed up
	[ ] When looking into a crate it will tell you when
		the contents will be randomized next

[ ] Unlocking crates of ammo/weapons
	[ ] Depending on where the crate is, an item is chosen
		[ ] If room contains Kojima
			[ ] Require the sacrifice of 'N tengu masks'
	[ ] When killing any tengu mob, they will drop a tengu mask

[ ] Dynamic mob scaling
	[x] scale a mob's attributes according to a level
	[x] copy extended type from source to scaled mob
	[x] copy the mob equipment profile to scaled mob
		**** ----- PRIORITY -------- ****
		[ ] use the rifle loot rifle randomization code to create randomized weapons
		[ ] equip scaled mob with randomized weapon
		[?] should this be deep rifle objects? might be easier to do that

[ ] `admin:raid:broadcast <ID>`
[x] `admin:raid list`
[x] `admin:raid remove <id>...[id-N]`
[ ] `admin:raid:reload`
	- reloads all raids from the db
	- cannot be ran if currently in raid pave mode
	

[ ] Randomized objectives that target currently playing players
	[ ] Loop over the currently playing player list
		[ ] create a randomized objective for that player's level
		[ ] send notice of randomized objective over MUD RADIO (<-- create this)
		[ ] create 'raid:join <N>' command, and when they type it in:
			[x] Create scaled mobs
				[ ] stretch goal, use a cut scene where the player boards a helicopter
					[ ] have it put them in helicopter limbo
					[ ] helicopter ride is over when the `admin:queue:refresh` call is done
						[ ] have the `admin:queue:refresh` functionality be tied to specific run ID's
							[ ] these ID's will allow the system to track when a refresh for specific content is done
			[ ] Disperse mobs and content to area
			[ ] Teleport player to raid location
			[ ] Mark player with specific contract and scripted steps
[ ] Set a designated spawn room where the player will teleport to
	[ ] create `raid:build:set-spawn <raid-id-N> <room_vnum|here|this>`
		[ ] Only needs to persist during runtime
