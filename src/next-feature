[ ] Lockers
	- Status:
		- currently, the weapons locker namespace (`admin:weapon-locker:*`) utilizes the new
		locker orm object. This is good because the way the integral objects code was implemented
		uses lmdb. this makes it very difficult to maintain since rooms do not properly cascade
		lmdb objects. 
			- what's working:
				- install:
					`admin:weapon-locker:install <quota> rifle/psg1.yml rifle/g36c.yml ... [item-N]`
				- listing (for removal):
					`admin:weapon-locker:list`
				- remove by id:
					`admin:weapon-locker:remove:item <id>...[id-N]`
						- to get a list of id's use `:list`
			- important technical details:
				- currently the locker contents of each weapons locker is CACHED.
					- for a full run-down of how this works, checkout
						mods::orm::locker_cache::*
			- TODO's:
				- no way to uninstall weapon locker
				- no way to set quota of an id
					- need to reflect this in the cache as well
	[ ] Weapon locker uninstall command
		[ ] mods::orm::locker needs `remove_locker` functionality
	[ ] Adapt all weapons locker sub-commands to the armor lockers namespace
	[ ] Adapt all weapons locker sub-commands to the ammo lockers namespace
	[ ] Adapt all weapons locker sub-commands to the catchy name namespace
	[ ] Adapt all weapons locker sub-commands to the camera feed  namespace
	[ ] Adapt a small subset of the weapons locker sub-commands to the sign namespace
	[ ] Adapt create_tier_1_armor_locker code to have the quota at the beginning
		[ ] just look for the TODO comment in that code and uncomment it
			- this relies on the armor lockers namespace being completed first

[ ] Every N+X ticks
	[ ] The contents of each crate are mixed up
	[ ] When looking into a crate it will tell you when
		the contents will be randomized next

[ ] Unlocking crates of ammo/weapons
	[ ] Depending on where the crate is, an item is chosen
		[ ] If room contains Kojima
			[ ] Require the sacrifice of 'N tengu masks'
	[ ] When killing any tengu mob, they will drop a tengu mask

[ ] Dynamic mob scaling
	[x] scale a mob's attributes according to a level
	[x] copy extended type from source to scaled mob
	[x] copy the mob equipment profile to scaled mob
		**** ----- PRIORITY -------- ****
		[ ] use the rifle loot rifle randomization code to create randomized weapons
		[ ] equip scaled mob with randomized weapon
		[?] should this be deep rifle objects? might be easier to do that

[ ] `admin:raid:broadcast <ID>`
[x] `admin:raid list`
[x] `admin:raid remove <id>...[id-N]`
[ ] `admin:raid:reload`
	- reloads all raids from the db
	- cannot be ran if currently in raid pave mode
	

[ ] Randomized objectives that target currently playing players
	[ ] Loop over the currently playing player list
		[ ] create a randomized objective for that player's level
		[ ] send notice of randomized objective over MUD RADIO (<-- create this)
		[ ] create 'raid:join <N>' command, and when they type it in:
			[x] Create scaled mobs
				[ ] stretch goal, use a cut scene where the player boards a helicopter
					[ ] have it put them in helicopter limbo
					[ ] helicopter ride is over when the `admin:queue:refresh` call is done
						[ ] have the `admin:queue:refresh` functionality be tied to specific run ID's
							[ ] these ID's will allow the system to track when a refresh for specific content is done
			[ ] Disperse mobs and content to area
			[ ] Teleport player to raid location
			[ ] Mark player with specific contract and scripted steps
[ ] Set a designated spawn room where the player will teleport to
	[ ] create `raid:build:set-spawn <raid-id-N> <room_vnum|here|this>`
		[ ] Only needs to persist during runtime




# Needed content
A new inventory room has been created
	[ ] Plans are to make this a shop where MP can be spent to upgrade gear
[ ] Need to populate Hydro Plant with dynamic mobs
	[ ] Need NPC's to spawn there
	[ ] Need to drop one of the various types of Shards ( see below )

[ ] Need to spawn level 10 NPC's for the euclid avenue areas south of Henley Fountain





# Behaviour trees
- [ ] orthos spawn sentinel btree
	- [ ] knockdown player
	- [ ] enforce last fight timestamp






# Larger features
- [ ] different types of shards
	- [ ] Marrow
		- [ ] HP/Medicinal/Boosters
	- [ ] Metallic
		- [ ] Ammunition/Grip
	- [ ] Razor
		- [ ] Intelligence related (FIXME)
	- [ ] Ionic
		- [ ] Elemental Resist/Damage




# ON HOLD
- [ ] upsert orm function
- [ ] sql create table from ORM TUPLE
	- [ ] using notch orm class as guinea pig
